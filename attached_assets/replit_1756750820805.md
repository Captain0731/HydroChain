# Overview

HydroChain is a decentralized marketplace for trading verified hydrogen credits, built as a Flask web application. The platform enables users to buy, sell, and track hydrogen offset credits through a blockchain-integrated system. The application focuses on promoting clean energy adoption by facilitating transparent trading of hydrogen credits from various production projects worldwide.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Web Framework Architecture
The application is built using Flask as the primary web framework with a traditional MVC pattern. The application uses Blueprint-style routing with templates rendered via Jinja2, providing a clean separation between presentation and business logic.

## Database Design
The system uses SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite as the default database, designed for easy migration to PostgreSQL. The data model consists of three core entities:

- **User**: Stores user profiles with wallet addresses, verification status, and total hydrogen offsets
- **HydrogenCredit**: Represents tradeable credits with project details, quantities (in kg H2), pricing, vintage years, and certification standards
- **Transaction**: Records all credit transfers between users with timestamps and quantities

The database relationships are established through foreign keys enabling proper transaction history tracking and credit ownership management.

## Authentication System
User authentication is designed around wallet addresses rather than traditional passwords. The system stores wallet addresses as unique identifiers and includes fields for verification status. The current implementation has basic session management with plans for MetaMask wallet integration.

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive design with custom CSS implementing a dark theme with blue and green accents. JavaScript handles Web3 wallet connectivity and dynamic marketplace interactions. Templates extend a base layout providing consistent navigation and styling across pages.

## Session Management
Flask sessions are used for user state management with configurable secret keys. The system includes temporary OTP storage for verification processes and maintains user login status across requests.

## Data Seeding System
A dedicated seeding module populates the database with sample hydrogen credits from various project types (electrolysis, steam reforming, etc.) and certifications (Green Hydrogen Standard, CertifHy, etc.) for development and testing purposes.
